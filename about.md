My name is **Se√±or Gus** but I'm mostly known on the internets as [SrfRoG][srfrog] üê∏

## Bio

- I was born in the (culturally) [richest island in the Caribbean][boriquen]. The beautiful island of **Boriqu√©n**.
- I studied *Electrical Engineering* in some university. It was interesting but not my passion, so I quit.
- While pursuing EECS I learned C and C++ which led me to *Computer Science*; I was instantly hooked.
- Currently, I work for a cool startup as a Lead Software Engineer, developing microservices in [Go][golang].
